        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>The goal of Daystar Daycare is to provide all children enrolled with a developmentally appropriate program that emphasizes the different areas of children’s development, which are physical, cognitive, emotional and social. Our classrooms are set up with a “hands-on” approach and provide opportunities for both self-directed and teacher directed activities.

          Children are given choices as to the activities they participate in. Teachers use observations, interest and abilities of children as well as individual needs in order to determine curriculum. A major goal is positive social interaction.
          
          Much of our preschool groups’ class time is teacher-led group activities and quite structured. Teachers emphasize academic skills and preparations for elementary school. Preschool groups are more structured with various activities taking place at set times. Emphasis is placed on learning numbers, colors, alphabet and early math and reading. Children learn through practice and repetition.</p>

        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <p>The objective of Daystar Daycare is to provide an environment that will allow children to feel good about themselves, approach challenges with optimism, explore their world with confidence and competence, and ultimately reach their full potential.

          Daystar Daycare encourages not just learning, but the love of learning. Our programs are designed to develop in children a sense of independence and responsibility by providing them opportunity to socialize and interact with other children and adults in a variety of structured and unstructured activities. We continually stress the importance of social skills and interactions.
          
          Daystar Daycare believes in positive methods of discipline and establishes consistent and appropriate limits to help children function in their world.</p>

<h1>What Our Parents Say</h1>

        I enrolled my son in a DayStar DayCare when he was 13 months old. I interviewed approximately 20 child care programs. The process of elimination began with the first phone call. Not only was the first phone call to KinderCare pleasant and inviting, but once I entered the building I noticed all of the teachers greeting each child in the hallway by name, with attention given to each child.
    
        The Assistant Director answered all of my many questions and once we did drop him off the first day, she was there, with tissues in hand, assuring us that our baby would be OK and that we could call her anytime to see how he was doing. And, she meant it. Anytime I called, she would check in on him and let me know how he was doing, and what he was doing – that extra bit of information gave it that special touch. She took that extra step.

        My daughter loves to go to "school." They make learning fun. She talks fondly of her teachers. In fact, she even said that one of her teachers "loves me" when she was two. Even at three, I still receive daily reports, which tell me how she eats, sleeps and plays. That can tell me a lot about any changes in her moods in the evenings.
    
        I could say more about the office staff, extra activities, etc. But in short, I recommend DayStar DayCare to all of my neighbors. I will be sad when she leaves there.
